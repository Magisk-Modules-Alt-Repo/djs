# Schedule Examples

# Run on boot
#boot touch /data/I-was-born-on-boot; : --delete
# ": --delete" is optional; it means "delete the schedule after execution" - effectively turning it into a one-time boot schedule.

# Apply Advanced Charging Controller night settings at 22:00
#2200 acc pc=45 rc=44 mcc=500000 mcv=3920

# Restore regular ACC settings at 6:00 (morning)
#0600 acc pc=75 rc=70 mcc= mcv=; : --boot
# ": --boot" is optional; it makes this schedule run on boot as well (e.g., as part of a fail-safe plan).
